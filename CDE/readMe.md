  ::params - param file to run the experimet
           - syntax to run: java -jar ECJ.jar -file evocomp.params
  ::data   - experimental data in compressed versions (*.gz)
           - ready to analyze data for sparsity and problem size (x.problems/sparsity.all)
  ::code   - Just the necessary class. Will be updated time to time
